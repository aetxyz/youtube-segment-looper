# YouTube-Segment-Looper

I've been learning Russian with immersion content primarily from YouTube,
and have been wanting a way to reduce the number of steps to set up
[chorusing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5JwiNSIHxY) for specific lines I
come across.

Chorusing is a great technique, but existing ways to set it up are, at least
to me, annoyingly burdensome. So I created this Chrome extension that loops a
YouTube video between specific timestamps of your choice. It's pretty basic,
but the idea is that if you just want to quickly chorus a specific part of a
video for a few minutes, you can loop it on the page and cut out the work of
downloading and cutting the audio. Obviously it doesn't record anything, so if
you want to listen to your own pronunciation (which you should!) that will still
require something like Audacity, but the idea here is just to remove some steps
from the process.

It's YouTube specific at the moment.

# Installation

You can download this from the
[GitHub page](https://github.com/aetxyz/youtube-segment-looper) (where
you probably are now) at the top, by clicking the green `Code` button and
selecting "Download ZIP". Then unzip that. You can delete everything except
the `YouTube-Segment-Looper` folder.

I don't have a Chrome developer account, nor do I really care to make one, so
right now to use this you need to download it and follow these instructions:

1. Go to chrome://extensions/
2. Press "Load unpacked" and select the YouTube-Segment-Looper folder
3. Navigate to YouTube and click the icon in your extensions tray to use it
